## 📊 Data Analytics with Jupyter Notebook  

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that explore data analytics concepts and techniques.  
Data analytics is the process of examining raw data to uncover meaningful insights, trends, and patterns that can support decision-making.  

Using these notebooks, you can:  

- **Load and clean datasets** – prepare raw data for analysis by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.  
- **Explore data visually** – use charts, graphs, and plots to identify patterns and relationships in the data.  
- **Apply statistical and analytical methods** – perform descriptive and inferential analysis to draw conclusions.  
- **Build predictive insights** – leverage machine learning models or statistical techniques to forecast outcomes.  
- **Communicate findings** – present results in a clear, interactive, and reproducible format with Jupyter.  

This project demonstrates how Python’s powerful data libraries (such as **pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn**) can be combined to turn raw data into actionable knowledge.
