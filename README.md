# ELEC303 Data Analytics

## 📌 Midterm Activities

### 🐧 [Activity 1 - Palmer Penguin](https://github.com/raiahyxs/Data-Analytics/blob/main/ITELEC03/activity%201.ipynb)
Explores the **Palmer Penguins dataset** to practice basic data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis for understanding species characteristics and relationships.

### 🛑 [Activity 2 - UK Accident](https://github.com/raiahyxs/Data-Analytics/blob/main/ITELEC03/activity%202.ipynb)
👉 Use Google Colab to view interactive visualizations and maps (if available):

🔗 [Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bjqU6dTWfeR5mY6nVuapOc29JIm7WNUc?usp=sharing)
Analyzes **UK Road Accident data** to identify patterns, trends, and contributing factors to traffic incidents using exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques.

### 🏙️ [Midterms Exam - Chicago Crime](https://github.com/raiahyxs/Data-Analytics/blob/main/ITELEC03/MIDTERMS%20EXAMS/MIDTERM_EXAM.ipynb)
👉 Use Google Colab to properly view interactive outputs such as the **Folium heatmap**

🔗 [Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1raNBgLtdxNUYyablbJ5BCgiTDmqK-Jeq?usp=sharing)
Examines the **Chicago Crime dataset** to explore crime patterns, trends, and relationships between crime types, locations, and temporal factors.
This activity uses data analytics techniques including:
- Aggregating crime counts by type, ward, and community area
- Visualizing spatial distribution of crimes with maps
- Temporal analysis by day, hour, and season

## 📌 Finals Activities

### 🦟 [Project 3 - PH Dengue Analysis](https://github.com/raiahyxs/Data-Analytics/blob/main/ITELEC03/FINALS-ACTIVITIES/PROJECT3_PH_DENGUE_ANALYSIS.ipynb)
Analyzes **Dengue cases in the Philippines** to understand trends, regional hotspots, and temporal patterns of the disease through data visualization and time-series analysis.

## 📊 Data Analytics with Jupyter Notebook

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that explore data analytics concepts and techniques.
Data analytics is the process of examining raw data to uncover meaningful insights, trends, and patterns that can support decision-making.

Using these notebooks, you can:

- **Load and clean datasets** – prepare raw data for analysis by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
- **Explore data visually** – use charts, graphs, and plots to identify patterns and relationships in the data.
- **Apply statistical and analytical methods** – perform descriptive and inferential analysis to draw conclusions.
- **Build predictive insights** – leverage machine learning models or statistical techniques to forecast outcomes.
- **Communicate findings** – present results in a clear, interactive, and reproducible format with Jupyter.

This project demonstrates how Python’s powerful data libraries (such as **pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, folium, and scikit-learn**) can be combined to turn raw data into actionable knowledge.
